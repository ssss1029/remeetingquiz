# Remeeting quiz submission

 - Q1: `query-hidden-number.py`
 - Q2: `variance.py`
 - Q3: `process.py`

I have also pushed my `env` folder that contains the python environment I used to develop my solutions, as well as a `requirements.txt`. One can start the environment with `source env/Scripts/activate` (this is a windows environment, so it probably not work with mac/linux). In this case, it would be ok to just install dependencies using `pip install requirements.txt`
